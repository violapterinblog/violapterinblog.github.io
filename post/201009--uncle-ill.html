<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The protagonist was aware that his uncle Xitai, his mother’s eldest brother, had cancer, only after it was getting serious.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The ominous but commonplace fact gradually sank into his cognitive capacity, by the time it was mentioned two or three times, starting from a worried call picked up by Mother in perhaps June, concluding with an announcement that he was admitted into palliative care.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Uncle and his family lived in the US, and the protagonist had only seen him twice,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and hence he didn’t feel much sadness, but merely emptiness that emerged every time he knew people was dying.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mother didn’t appear to be weeping, though, and he didn’t bring up the matter.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And he could only imagine how devastated Xitai’s wife Defen was, from the broken English (even having stayed in the US for decades) she wrote on Line to repeatedly ask the Lord for his blessing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was a anesthesiologist, and was attentive of his health;</span> <span class="serif-roman">he was frugal with money and hard working.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then still he got ill, suddenly due to a recurring of throat cancer, about one month just before he retired, which stopped him from enjoying his remaining days.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Lately he was drinking only cokes, and locked himself in his room.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe because he could well research his own survival curve.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Was it a coincidence that the protagonist was reading «Simply Nietzsche» by Peter Kail, when he had the train of thought below?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In «The Birth of Tragedy», the book explained, Nietzsche was answering the pessimism of Schopenhauer’s,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and according to Schopenhauer, our life was essentially no more than a never-ending but meaningless suffering.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nietzsche so responded—it continued—that it was only through the intoxication in art that we could unite as a whole, finding the power to overcome the bleak reality.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How terrifying it would be, he imagined, to face death, such that many who in their last functional phase converted from atheists to believers, even most intelligent ones including Einstein and Grothendieck.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What precisely changed them?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He knew it, that religion helped people cope with their short and brutal life.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But how was they persuaded that what they yearned for existed, as long as they genuinely yearned for it?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(He once spent some time reading a post on Reddit which asked believers who converted, what the reason was;</span> <span class="serif-roman">he read the whole thing,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and that didn’t make him any more emphatic with them.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The next day he went to Gongguan as usual, and walked into the Campus Bookstore the first time it finished remodeling;</span> <span class="serif-roman">affiliated to the church, the building was just across the street from the National Taiwan University.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One of the displayed books was «The Reason for God» by Timothy Keller,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he recalled Isaac the chess player, in one of his apologetic posts, had shared quotes by Keller.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He picked it up and skimmed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Since we had a natural tendency to crave for something more than the material world—it said—didn’t it hint that the immaterial realm could actually exist?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He put it down and went upstairs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was here that once Celia pressed him to join a church gathering for interpretation of the Bible, and he wouldn’t, which led to constant arguments of theirs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now there were much fewer books, with those Chinese translations of classic literature disappearing except certainly the Bibles, leaving a more hollow second floor.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That very night, 3 or 4 in the morning, the protagonist heard in addition that Xitai was dying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People died, and he would die too, he so thought in his vanishing consciousness when he fell asleep.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Why did we believe that our life was valuable, that we had to help each other, and that we would’t be merely dust when we were gone?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As long as such possibilities made us feel better?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This was just optimism in the extreme, he realized.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Many accepted it, which was hard to blame.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But not him.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People died together, but he must die alone.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He must himself face the emptiness, loneliness, depression, sickness, and death—what life had yet really offered, but would certainly offer, in abundance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Except perhaps with the companion of music, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche would have claimed when facing the dilemma, and the sense of connection he felt in creating them, he would linger a little longer on the land of earth, however evanescent it was as it died in the air, however dissolving already into nothingness.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Some 6 hours later, as he woke up, Father read the messages on Line announcing that Xitai had passed away.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was 74, not at all old to modern eyes.</span></span>
