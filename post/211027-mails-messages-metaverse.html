<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the film «Ready Player One», people are connected to the Oasis, a virtual reality platform, where only your imagination is the limit.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">You can fight with King Kong, dance in the middle of the air, or talk to holograms of the deceased.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I watched in 2019 the movie, which moved me to tears, I thought that the Oasis is actually not implausible within some 40 years.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With the advent of virtual reality, it is remarkable that the author Ernest Cline had such a vision as early as in 2011.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, recently the concept of the “metaverse” is trending, due to the news that Facebook is focusing on its VR system Horizon Worlds even decides on October 28, 2021 to change its name “Facebook” to “Meta” in order to show the shift of concentration.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Wow, I don’t see that the Oasis is happening almost right now and here.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The direction of immersive technologies, however, made me more wary than excited.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In fact, it appears to be a turning point in the tug of war on the conception of interpersonal boundaries.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Think about how much has changed in the past 50 years in an exponential acceleration.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Meeting used to be the only way of communication.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mails existed thousands of years ago, and telegrams, just one hundred years ago.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then email and text messages came into view in the whirl of the internet revolution,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and social media and video calls emerged in the last decade, thanks to the growth of internet speed.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Our mentality of interpersonal boundaries, consequently, experiences a drastic change.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When people in the last generation would rather meet, young people go out less and treasure more private space.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For example, if my mom has a problem with the post office, she goes to the office,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but for me, I wish I could reply in emails.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When she wants to contact an electronic repair shop, she simply makes a phone call,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I would book on the internet.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To her, a phone call gets things done within a minute,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but emails are a hassle.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To me, it is more convenient to record the dialogue in messages,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I have difficulty memorizing what was said in a meeting.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To be sure, social media helped me make friends and disclose myself in a safe, sheltered space, in my messy study or on a shaded park bench.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I can reply to online friends after taking my time when I am in the mood.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Likewise, TVs and movie theaters are replaced by Youtube and Netflix, which isn’t confined to a specific time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Space is therefore expanded and time blurred,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we are liberated from the hectic city and soar beyond the realm of our senses.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Text bears our thoughts and values,</span> <span class="serif-roman">voice unveils our emotions and manners,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the image, though consuming the most computational complexity, carries our appearance rather than essence.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Among them, language is the pinnacle of our civilization.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It can be seen as the prototype metaverse, a network consisting of past and future, possibility and contradiction, individuality and generality,    which you dive in,       hoping that your peculiarity might at all be understood by somebody in front of you or from the opposite time zone,          who likes to listen to Gregorian chants in the rain or to bone the fish before eating, exactly as you do.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Instead, there seems to be a reverse trend nowadays, which claims the secret garden from us, but leaves us in a frantic traffic jam.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Blogs disappeared,</span> <span class="serif-roman">Facebook entered,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and in turn came Instagram, and finally Tiktok, Clubhouse, and a resurging Youtube.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So much, medium asks me to put an image, because people seldom finish a long wall of text now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Wordpress provides me with a weird option to turn my post into a podcast.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Honestly I don’t get it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I miss the age of texts.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Socializing is already tough in social media.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Initially you worry whether the reply that you aren’t going to the concert is mild enough, and whether your recent criticism on the the ruling party conforms to majority of your friends’.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then you worry whether the filter applied to your food is vivid enough, and whether the meme of Shiba Inu is out of fashion.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What next?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The metaverse will import the social anxiety from real life to virtual reality.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In time, in a party you attend through your avatar, will recur the old fear that you are less attractive, less humorous, less erudite, less charismatic, and not knowing to grip a glass of bordeaux at the base.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Impossible.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Like you move a stew away from an ant colony to another table, only to find the next morning that it has attracted another colony.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">You know what the word “person” means?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Masks, the kind for dramatic actors in ancient Greece, or in modern times mails, messages, or the metaverse.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The festival is about to begin,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and torches are lit all over the arena.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Don’t mind what is behind the mask, the birthmarks and the scars.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Watch the show.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Give me a mask,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I will tell you the truth.”</span></span>
