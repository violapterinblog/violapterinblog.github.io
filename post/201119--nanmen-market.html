<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">❧</span> <em class="serif-italic">by Jingting the gourmet</em></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The original Nanmen Market [南門市場] is a curious place,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and lately some dear recollections have resurfaced.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When it comes to the new-year shopping in those “groceries from South to North” [南北貨], Dihua street [迪化街] and Nanmen Market are the prime choices.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The retreat to Taiwan back in the Chinese civil war incidentally endowed us dishes in the “eight styles”,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and a thorough walk in Nanmen’s does provide a representative if incomplete sample.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Seldom have I bought ingredients from Nanmen’s, after I started cooking myself.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A few kinds of supplies I do replenish are dried foods—the cured Jinhua ham [金華火腿] for stewing, infant shrimps for frying, baby fish for sauces, and scallop for steamed egg.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A slight disappointment is however the lack of Xinjiang pepper as of now, which has a flavor heavy but not excessively spicy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To make the fried-cured-meat-with-garlic-leaf, which I crave for every year or two, one can’t go wrong with Nanmen’s, or possibly the “Peng’s Hunan Cured Meat” [彭記湖南臘肉].</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The stinky tofu, if steamed rather than fried, I tell you, smells ten times worse.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If you find it not strong enough, do leave that in room temperature for days to let it ferment,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the softer it is, the more stinky, so much that it can well deserve a quarantine in the balcony.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I stopped buying it upon discovering that it is made from gene-modified soybeans, and later, to avoid extra estrogen in it.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Jinhua ham too is finicky to make, in that, rather unlike the honey-cured ham, it requires more than a year to age.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But an old store I frequent has their own bacteria colonies, and even their own factory in Taoyuan that insists on using local Taiwan pork: a principle (which I failed to appreciate before) rare in the time of pig pandemic and with the presence of the contending imported US pork.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">While Guangdong people love to have the ham-in-steamed-soup, ham actually originated in Zhejiang in the era of Northern Song.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The Northeastern sour cabbage, equally indispensable in seasoning the hot pot, is another thing:</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As the salt brings out the sweetness, the sour cabbage rids the oil.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Indeed I have once, out of rebelliousness, made a sour-cabbage-with-fat-meat pot with leaner pork,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and they simply didn’t go well,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I so realized the wisdom of insisting fat meat passed all along from the ancestors.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But as for cooked food, quite a few highly regard the Yichang Royal House [億長御坊], where I remember a more friendly price before it enjoyed its fame.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The sweet-sour ribs, and the baby-fish-with-chillies have stayed in my childhood memories;</span> <span class="serif-roman">though after I could cook better, I hardly purchase them any longer.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Still there are the “Lion’s Head” (a stewed meatball), and the braised-goldfish-with-green-onion, one in Huaiyang style and one in Sichuan style, all so intricate yet meticulous prepared that I can hardly tell the original ingredients by their final look,</span> <span class="serif-roman">hence my principle of refraining from eating out is reluctantly compromised, when I fancy them once in a long while.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Just next to the stairs in the basement of Nanmen’s, is a stand of Chouzhou-style Zongzi [潮州粽], which at its best is comparable to that of Dintaifung’s [鼎泰豐].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Another stand sells some mantou, baozi, among other sweet breads and pastas.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(But you have to go up to the second floor for babaofan, a sweet rice with fruits.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Further down the basement are stands of raw foods, such as some ridiculously priced vegetables, and giant pork rib bones excellent for stew, which are sold out so early in the morning.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the end of hall, before electronic slaughter was popularized by the government, there used to be a stand of raw chicken,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it was there that I have seen chicken slaughtered, blood drained, and hair removed by hot water.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The peculiar dark walk therefore cast, for some time, a long shadow in me when I was a kid.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Jinfeng’s [金峰] Lobahpng [滷肉飯], or ‘rice with minced pork’, served there with fried tofu, is something I have favored as a kid,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but my taste buds somehow no longer prefer them.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">While it has been a tourists’ place of interest, the incredibly long queue always astonishes me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A path near Jinfeng’s leads to a stand of Loumei [滷味], or ‘soy-braised snacks’.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There, they know how to cure ingredients overnight to let the sauce in.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Tofu, chicken wings, chicken legs, and wood-ears are the best in my opinion,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the holder is so good at advertising, that you have to “harden your ear” and stand firm in your ground.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">PS.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The original Nanmen Market is being remodeled, and has moved into a makeshift building for now.</span></span>
