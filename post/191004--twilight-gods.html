<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This was the first time I entered this lofty modernistic building having opened about precisely 3 years ago.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One walked in the middle of huge curved pillars, and came up several set of stairs to get to the big hall where the performance was to take place.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There were other smaller-sized halls.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There, a large orchestra pit could be accommodated, which National Concert Hall couldn’t do.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Before the performance, I attended a helpful listening guide starting at about 16:00 in the medium hall, presented by Daiwei Lü [呂岱衛].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We were given free brochures, which summarized the plot and leitmotifs (without score examples).</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Act 1 lasted from 17:15 to 19:10, Act 2 from 19:45 to 20:45, Act 3 from 21:10 to 22:30.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the two long intermissions, stands were selling absurdly expensive light food,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but hungry people still bought that, including me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When it ended, I feared that I couldn’t catch the train back to Taipei.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I managed to stay for another 10 minutes to give stand ovation, which was more important.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then I took a taxi, and caught the very last train, making perfect use of every minute.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Previously, I kind of thought Wagner to be dry, even hypnotic.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">While this Spanish team had collaborated with National Taichung Theater for 4 years in a row, this time I decided to give the last one in the franchise a try.</span> <span class="serif-roman">I wondered what a full-fledged production of the «Ring» would be like,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the «Ring» wasn’t commonly performed in entirety.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And I didn’t regret it at all!</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Wagner was meant to be watched after all.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With the 3 000 NTD ticket, I was seated at the point one-third-the-width to the right wall, and one-third-the-depth to the back wall, close enough to see their facial expression.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The acoustic experience was really great.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The orchestra played smoothly,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I couldn’t identify any mistake.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Tubas, timpani, and double bassoons were particularly grandiose to hear in real time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The singers were impressive too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Apart from daunting register and sheer volume that Wagner demands, the roles of Siegfried and Brünnhilde called for a youthful vividness.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In particular, Siegfried’s part was challenging;</span> <span class="serif-roman">there were passages marked piano but involving notes as high as</span> <code class="mono">a&#39;</code> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and his highest note was</span> <code class="mono">c&#39;&#39;</code><span class="serif-roman">!</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When he was dying–kneeling and lying face-down on the floor and calling Brünnhilde–Siegfried’s player sang as effortlessly as before.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Hagen’s player had a particularly sonorous voice, being somehow coarse but not displeasingly so, which strangely suited the sinister character.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though the voices of Siegfried and Brünnhilde’s players were able to compete with the orchestra, the resounding voice of Hagen’s was particularly overwhelming.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Meanwhile, the singers’ interpretation appeared to be more controlled than liberal, perhaps because I was too accustomed to recordings.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the other hand, the stage and costume design were eccentric.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The costume was in the style of science fiction.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That apart, there were more strange symbolisms all over the place, like numbers in Chinese characters, and a</span> <span class="math"><span class="math-letter">\(\pi\)</span></span> <span class="serif-roman">as big as his chest printed on the back of Gunther’s coat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(I didn’t expect LaTeX to come in handy in this music review.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everybody was in western suits, except for the quasi-primitive outfit Siegfried wore in the beginning.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Most of the time, the stage was free of props,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the surroundings were hinted only by projected images.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The minimalism certainly wasn’t what Wagner had expected, considering that the composer built a cutting-edge theater to host his lavish production.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The minimalism could be too much, for example in the very last dramatic event, where Hagen should have been devoured into the Rhine.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This wasn’t shown literally, but instead Hagen rode on a electronic unicycle and fell onto the ground.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(It was difficult to tell what was happening in the midst of a swarm of acrobats.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There were some acrobat performances, which wasn’t a bad thing, but such endeavor wasn’t integrated smoothly to the story.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In end of Act 1, the performers in skin-colored bodysuit, possibly suggesting they were naked, wiggled on the rock on which Brünnhilde resided, when Siegfried, disguised as Gunther, swore by the sword that he wouldn’t touch Brünnhilde.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then in the end of Act 2, the performers made virtuoso jumps in the realm of gods.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And in the end of Act 3, the performers, hung like flying trapeze, again impressively circled around Siegfried’s dead body, which was supposedly the building of Valhalla.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(It might be due to ease of arrangement, that they always introduced acrobats in the concluding section only.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wasn’t sure about what these acrobat sections signified.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nevertheless, they did make good use of the vertical visual room of the spacious hall.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In addition to acrobats, the director was trying very hard to prevent audiences from sleeping, by projecting animation on the screen, when instrumental interludes were playing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It showed, for instance, in Act 2 the sea Siegfried was sailing in, when he went on his adventures.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But animation could be a tad ludicrous, considering the serious nature of the drama.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The plot of the whole «Ring» cycle is mostly well-thought-out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Interlocking action, out of love and hatred, loyalty and betrayal, makes characters well-rounded and sophisticated.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Introduction of physical devices, like the ring and the helmet, often foreshadows later development.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is so heart-wrenching that, if any character had thrown the ominous ring away, they would have avoided their doom,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and even the fearless Sigfried couldn’t overcome his fate.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Admittedly, there are some inconsistency in the plot.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To take an example, in the end of Act 2, surely Gunter doesn’t know the fact that Brünnhilde has been united with Siegfried.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But when Brünnhilde says that there is a vulnerable spot on Siegfried’s back, doesn’t Gunter suspect that there is something between them?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As another instance, why is Siegfried just about to come to the Gibichungs’ castle, the moment Hagen, Gunther, and Gutrune there finishes the discussion of their evil plan?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(Such problems might also be due to the limitation of scene transition.)</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Speaking of Wagner’s music, the heart of his success, or failure, is his use of leitmotifs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In its best, the effect is remarkably satisfying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As Siegfried recounts his adventure, previous leitmotifs appear, corresponding to the topic, all constructed tightly and organically.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When Brünnhilde jumps into the flames to her death, a series of interwoven leitmotifs eloquently summarizes the whole franchise, suggesting the theme of destruction and redemption.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then how can Wagner still appears abstruse to many?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It may have something to do, I guess, with his melodies, which usually lacks distinctive contour.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They follow leitmotifs rather faithfully,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and they aren’t changed and developed as much as what Beethoven often does.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Having went to the opera, I remember very little of the melody,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the ever-repeating leitmotifs are hard to forget, even irritating.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Also, Wagner seldom writes heavy contrapuntal lines, nor introduces complicated rhythms.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Most sections feature a single voice, as if the singers are just another instrument,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I would appreciate if he had written more duets and trios.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(The argument between Gunter, Brünnhilde, and Hagen in the end of Act 2, is one of the scarce examples of a trio.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Sometimes Wagner uses higher chords and their rarer variations, like the half-diminished ninth</span> <code class="mono">{C; A; F; D} / B</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">where the minor ninth is really clashing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But apart from such peculiarities, he keeps a fairly classical vocabulary, which can sound incongruous.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Wagner still isn’t one of my favorite composers;</span> <span class="serif-roman">to me, the leitmotif thing doesn’t quite work out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I recognize his effort and praise his ingenuity,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I do replay other «Ring» albums on Spotify from time to time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Perhaps some day my liking for him will grow, perhaps not.</span></span>
