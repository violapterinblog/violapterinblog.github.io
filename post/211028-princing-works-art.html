<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On October 5, 2018, London Sotheby sold at auction a copy of «Girl with Balloon», a painting by Banksy, at a record price 1 042 000 GBP.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As soon as the deal was done, the painting slid down,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and half of it was sliced through by a shredder hidden in the frame.</span> <span class="serif-roman">the sliced copy was consequently renamed «Love is in the Bin».</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A few days later, one art collector who owned a copy of «Girl with Balloon» reportedly sliced it himself in imitation of Banksy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Instead, it was estimated that the slices were only worth the price of waste papers.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Three years later, on October 14, 2021, «Love is in the Bin» was sold at another auction for 18 582 000 GBP.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Apart from the question why «Girl with Balloon» is so expensive, why is the sliced «Girl with Balloon» worth even more?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If tearing the painting is a certain performance art, which I sort of understand, why can only Banksy himself do it to increase its price?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Is price equal to artistic value?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If not, what does price signify?</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As for music compositions, the assessed price of a manuscript is unlikely related to its perceived artistic value.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Suppose that two people are disputing whether Chopin’s «Ballade No 1» is a great work.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They debate on the balance of the form, the naturalness of the melody, the design of harmony, and the practicality of technique.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But it would appear totally absurd to argue its value basing on the price at which Chopin’s corresponding manuscript is recently sold.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What about paintings?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To write this note, I took a look at some of the most expensive paintings on Wikipedia.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For example, I find it hard to justify that «Salvator Mundi» by Leonardo da Vinci (450 300 000 USD) is several times more expensive than «Irises» by Vincent van Gogh (53 900 000 USD).</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What does it mean to say the price of «Salvator Mundi» is (considering inflation) some 4 times that of «Irises»?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nor is there an absolute reason that those paintings by van Gogh in a similar style are all so much cheaper than «Irises».</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To sort out the puzzle, let us continue the analogy in music.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In my view, «Ballade No 1» is a greater work than «Mariage d’amour»,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the costs to listen respectively to them doesn’t evidently differ.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A ticket price for a popular piano concert and one for a classical piano concert are in the same order of magnitude.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On Spotify you can listen to both,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and listening on YouTube is virtually free.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Obviously, when «Ballade No 1» is played at a concert, the ticket price isn’t some million dollars.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The price of music, more or less, reflects the cost of physical transmission, rather than its artistic value, which people are free to judge.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Where does the confusion lie?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There is a crucial difference between the cases of painting and music, namely that a painting is confined at a point of space and time;</span> <span class="serif-roman">on the contrary, music, drama, poetry, and other forms of art aren’t.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There is only one true physical realization which is «Irises»,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but there can be potentially infinitely many recordings of «Ballade no 1», or performances of «Antigone», or printed copies of «War and Peace».</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If economic principles are valid here, then the more supply there is, the less the equilibrium price.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thus a painting is hardly regulated by the supply curve,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but other art forms are.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To complicate the matter, the pricing of physical works of visual art, I guess, is due much to the monopoly of industry.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Paintings become Giffen goods, which more people demand even when their prices rise.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They are a means for rich people to show off, to invest in, or even to do the money laundry.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Critics, dealers, and collectors collaborate to hype the price, thus ensuring the value of their possessions.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To break down the vile system, our hope lies in Google Arts and other digital exhibitions, which overthrow the above premise that a painting has only one realization.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Do yourself a favor,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and see a van Gogh painting online, which is even clearer as you would have seen in a museum!</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Furthermore, it is worthwhile to advocate digital art for the next generation of artists.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A work of digital art can be copied and should be accessible to everybody.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though physical art has its merits, digital art surely has a lot more dimensions to explore.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Hopefully more people will value works of art, not by the price at which it is sold, but, well, by its artistic value —no matter what they think that is.</span></span>
