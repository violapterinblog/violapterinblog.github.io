<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In March 2020, I saw on Facebook a post saying that Nine Chapters [九章], a mathematics bookstore, was about to close at the end of 2020,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and that they were having a clearance sale.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The post was written by the shop owner, Mr Wenxian Sun himself.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Few days later, fearing good books would soon get sold out, I visited to Nine Chapters, some six years after the last time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Recognizing the plaque in calligraphic style, I pushed the glass door, which struck the wind chime, and entered the once-familiar room, with shorter shelves in the center and taller shelves in the surroundings.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On top of the shorter shelves were various puzzles, games, and models, including the Rush Hour, the Soma cube, Chinese rings, and wooden polyhedra, many of which I owned when I was a kid, as if my childhood memories were some donated organs, taken out and being dissected on an operation table.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I was in elementary school, I was a quiet boy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The boys would play basketball at recess,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I avoided them by reading at my seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When my classmates talked about «Naruto» or «Slam Dunk», I didn’t even know where to borrow comic books.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One day the instructor asked us to take a favorite book to share with classmates,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I took an album of Maurits Escher’s engravings, and sat attentively like a dutiful guide in a museum, waiting for anyone who appreciated for a second the marvel of the hyperbolic tiles.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I was in the second grade—at which time Taiwan saw a flurry of popular science publications—Father bought me translations of «Mathematics: The Man-made Universe» by Sherman Stein, «Trigonometric Delights» by Eli Maor, and «In Code» by Sarah Flannery, among others.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I kept reading and pestering him to buy me more of them, such as «Mathematical Sorcery» by Calvin Clawson and «How to Ace Calculus» by Colin Adams and others.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then, when I was in the eighth grade, after finishing an introduction to Euclid’s «Elements», I resolved to read «Elements» itself, of which Nine Chapters had published a translation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The translation wasn’t found at downtown bookstores,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Father accompanied me to Nine Chapters to purchase.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I read the «Elements» in three months, which I remarked on the copyright page.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Immersed in their products, I was tempted to think that all that mathematics was, was a bunch of puzzles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I fashioned a Soma cube with clay according to an article of Martin Gardner’s, and constructed a slide rule copied from a plan in «Scientific American».</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I liked to study the Lonpos pyramid [龍博士魔術金字塔] and the Rush Hour, and to build molecule models from magnetic balls and sticks.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(Once I lost a ball, Father intended to purchase another set for me,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Mr Sun gave him just one ball for free.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was also fascinated by the software Super Sketchbook [超級畫板], which made use of Gröbner basis in a polynomial ideal to decide geometrical propositions.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Eventually, Mr Sun must have remembered us, who visited so often.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the ninth grade, I spent little time preparing for the Basic Competence Test [基本學力測驗], which wasn’t difficult for me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Instead, I read expositions on Gödel incompleteness theorem and Fermat last theorem, when I was in the eighth grade.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I forced myself to read several pages a day,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I doubt how much I really understood by then about recursive functions or elliptic curves.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mathematics is something certain for me to get along with.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is an amusement park built exclusively for me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I know when the recorded scream is going to be played in the haunted mansion,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I am going to play again.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One slot machine is out of order, which lets me enjoy my pathetic victory.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ride the carousel in eerily vivid colors, and laugh hysterically as many times as I want.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Every day is sunny underneath the painted sky on the ceiling.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mr Wenxian Sun and his wife established Bookstore Nine Chapters in 1978, named after a nine-chapter mathematical treatise in the Han dynasty, since he found educational materials on mathematics to be lacking.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By then, Taiwan and Mainland China had made temporary peace,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the Cold War hadn’t ended;</span> <span class="serif-roman">mr Sun grasped the opportunity of introducing books from the other side of the strait (including translations of books in Soviet Union), and published those in Simplified Chinese again in Traditional Chinese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In their prime, many dissertations of top university students in Taiwan used to be typeset by Nine Chapters.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Their book covers look so shabby, I suspect they are done with Microsoft Paint.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If you inspect closely enough, you will find traces of phototypesetting.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The letters aren’t perfectly aligned,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and some strokes are fainter.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Equations are riddled with typos, which can confuse me for hours;</span> <span class="serif-roman">Mr Sun says on the website that they don’t have time to fix all of that.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">TeX and LaTeX matured in the 1990s,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and digital typesetting of mathematics has gradually become the norm.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nowadays books from China can be shipped to Taiwan with one click,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and kids are getting more than accustomed to Simplified Chinese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now, Bookstore Nine Chapters is having a clearance sale.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Today, I had a hard time finding any book worth buying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Olympiad problems, classical geometry, and solitaire board games, none of them seemed important anymore.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had learnt analysis, statistics, and algebra, not too much but enough to take these toys lightly.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Yet there are grown-ups who consider none of these to be important, except of their cars, houses, and children.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And maybe they will end up being correct.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or maybe we will get old enough to realize that nothing matters at all.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everything is a puzzle we play to feel being here.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wonder which is more absurd, finding something you once cherished to appear foolish, or knowing something you now cherish will appear foolish.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I picked «First-Order Logic» by Raymond Smullyan, «A Modern View of Geometry» by Leonard Blumenthal, and a collection of Olympiad inequalities.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wasn’t sure why I needed those;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I just wanted to pay for something.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mr Sun asked me by the cashier, “You really don’t want the Chinese translation of Olympiad inequalities, which is so much cheaper?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Um, no, thanks.”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Well, if you say so.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I can’t remember the price.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How much is the Olympiad Inequalities?” He called his wife.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Whatever.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Young man, let’s just call it 400 NTD.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Oh, really?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I paused, overwhelmed in memories.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What’s up?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He asked, not recognizing me.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Nothing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thank you very much.”</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I didn’t come to Nine Chapters again,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I visualized the place being remodeled to a shoe store or Boba tea stand, which might make me sentimental on seeing it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, I heard recently that Nine Chapters was still open, because several loyal customers appealed Mr Sun not to close it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I told myself that I should check it out,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but somehow, I didn’t feel any more urged to go either,</span> <span class="serif-roman">perhaps so I could stick to the picture of it being torn down.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The building, I imagine, is about to be obliterated, where the shelves have collapsed, the polyhedron models is dislodged from the latch, and plastic cars is littered on the ground.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have to carefully step over broken glass to enter the unlit room.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Curling up in the corner, a little boy is playing the Rush Hour again.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What are you doing here?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I asked him.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“I can’t get the red car out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It’s stuck in a traffic jam.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There must be one and only one way to do it.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Leave it alone.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We have to get out of this place, not the car!”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What if the car gets lonely?”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“It doesn’t;</span> <span class="serif-roman">you do.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">You get lonely sometimes,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and you play puzzles, one after another.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But playing puzzles never stops you from being lonely.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So put that down</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And come with me.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He screams.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“But I must get it out!</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Help me get it out!”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I part the debris to cross my legs beside him, as sands and rocks keep falling.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“One more puzzle,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we leave, okay?”</span></span>
