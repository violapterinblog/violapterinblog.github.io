<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In February 2020, I saw on Facebook a post saying that Nine Chapters [九章], a mathematics bookstore, was to be closed at the end of 2020,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and that they were having a clearance sale.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The post was written by the shop owner, Mr Wenxian Sun [孫文先] himself.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On March 3, fearing good books would soon get sold out, I visited Nine Chapters, years later since the last time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Recognizing the plaque in calligraphic style, I pushed the glass door, which struck the wind chime, and entered the once-familiar room with shorter shelves in the center and taller shelves in the surroundings.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On top of the shorter shelves were various puzzles, games, and models, including the Rush Hour, the Soma cube, the Tower of Hanoi, and wooden polyhedra, many of which I owned when I was a kid, as if my childhood memories were some donated organs, taken out and being dissected on an operation table.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I was in elementary school, I was a quiet boy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When my classmates played basketball at recess, I avoided them by reading at my seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When my classmates talked about «Naruto» or «Slam Dunk», I didn’t even know where to borrow comic books.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One day the instructor asked us to take a favorite book to share with classmates,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I took an album of Maurits Escher’s engravings, and sat attentively like a dutiful guide in a museum, waiting for anyone who appreciated for a second the marvel of hyperbolic tiles.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I was in the second grade—at which time Taiwan saw a flurry of popular science publications—Father bought me translations of «Mathematics: The Man-made Universe» by Sherman Stein, «Trigonometric Delights» by Eli Maor, and «In Code» by Sarah Flannery, among others.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I kept reading and pestering him to buy me more of them, such as «Mathematical Sorcery» by Calvin Clawson and «How to Ace Calculus» by Colin Adams and others.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then, when I was in the eighth grade, after finishing an introduction to Euclid’s «Elements», I resolved to read «Elements» itself, of which Nine Chapters had published a translation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The translation wasn’t found at downtown bookstores,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Father accompanied me to Nine Chapters to purchase.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I read the «Elements» within some 3 months, which I remarked on the copyright page.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nine Chapters’s puzzles soon attracted me, so much that I almost thought that all that mathematics was, was a long series of puzzles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I fashioned a Soma cube with clay according to an article of Martin Gardner’s, and constructed a slide rule copied from a plan in «Scientific American».</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I liked to study the Lonpos pyramid [龍博士魔術金字塔] and the Rush Hour,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I built molecule models from magnetic balls and sticks.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(Once I lost a ball,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Father intended to purchase another set for me,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but Mr Sun gave him just one ball for free.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Eventually, Mr Sun must have remembered us, who visited so often,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he sometimes gave us discounts.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the ninth grade, I spent little time preparing for the Basic Competence Test [基本學力測驗], which wasn’t difficult for me at all.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I would rather read Nine Chapters’s expositions on advanced mathematics.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I forced myself to read several pages a day on Gödel incompleteness theorem and Fermat last theorem, though I doubt how much I really understood by then about recursive functions or elliptic curves.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was also fascinated by the software Super Sketchbook [超級畫板], which made use of Gröbner basis in a polynomial ideal to decide geometrical propositions, a fact I learnt many years later.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mathematics is some precious certainty that provides good company for me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is an amusement park built exclusively for me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I know when the recorded scream is to be played in the haunted mansion,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I am going to enter again.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One broken slot machine lets me enjoy another pathetic victory.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ride the carousel in eerily vivid colors, and laugh hysterically as many times as I want.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Every day is sunny underneath the painted sky on the ceiling.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mr Sun and his wife established in 1978 Bookstore Nine Chapters, named after a nine-chapter mathematical treatise in the Han dynasty, since he found educational materials on mathematics to be lacking.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By then, Taiwan and Mainland China had made temporary peace,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the Cold War hadn’t ended;</span> <span class="serif-roman">Mr Sun grasped the opportunity of introducing books from the other side of the strait (especially Simplified Chinese translations of Russian books in the Soviet Union), and typeset those in Simplified Chinese again in Traditional Chinese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In their prime, many dissertations of top university students used to be formatted by Nine Chapters.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Their book covers look so shabby, I suspect they are done by Microsoft Paint.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If you inspect closely enough, you will find traces of manual typesetting:</span> <span class="serif-roman">the letters aren’t perfectly aligned,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and some strokes are fainter;</span> <span class="serif-roman">they must have cut and glued paper scraps on the master copy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What’s worse, equations are riddled with typos, which can confuse me for hours.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, they don’t have time to fix all of that,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but they will scan their older publications and release the electronic files for free.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">TeX and LaTeX matured in the 1990s,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and digital typesetting of mathematics has gradually become the norm.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, books from China can nowadays be shipped to Taiwan with one click,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and kids are getting more than accustomed to Simplified Chinese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now, Bookstore Nine Chapters is having a clearance sale.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Today, I had a hard time finding any book worth buying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Olympiad problems, classical geometry, and solitaire board games, they no longer seemed important anymore.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had learnt analysis, statistics, and algebra, not too much but enough to take them lightly.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Yet there are grown-ups who don’t even consider analysis, statistics, and algebra to be important, except of their cars, houses, and children.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And maybe they will end up being correct.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or maybe we will get old enough to realize that nothing matters whatsoever.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everything is a puzzle we play to feel being here.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wonder which is more devastating: finding something you once cherished to appear foolish, or knowing something you now cherish will appear foolish.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I picked «First-Order Logic» by Raymond Smullyan, «A Modern View of Geometry» by Leonard Blumenthal, and a guide on Olympiad inequalities.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wasn’t sure why I needed those;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I just wanted to pay for something.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mr Sun asked me by the cashier, “You really don’t want the Chinese translation of Olympiad inequalities, which is so much cheaper?”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Um, no, thanks.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Well, if you say so.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Strangely, I can’t find the record of the price.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How much is the Olympiad inequalities?” He called his wife.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Whatever.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Young man, let’s just call it 400 NTD.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Oh, really?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I paused, overwhelmed in memories.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What’s up?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He asked, not recognizing me.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“It’s nothing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thank you very much.”</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I didn’t come to Nine Chapters again,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I visualized the place being remodeled to a shoe store or a Boba tea stand, which might make me sentimental on seeing it.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, another one and half year later, I heard recently that Nine Chapters was still open, because several loyal customers appealed Mr Sun not to close it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I told myself that I should check it out,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but somehow, I didn’t feel any more urged to go either,</span> <span class="serif-roman">perhaps so I could stick to the picture of it being torn down.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The building, I imagine, is about to be obliterated, where the shelves have collapsed, the polyhedron models are dislodged from the latches, and toy blocks are littered all over the ground.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have to carefully step over broken glass to enter the unlit room.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Curling up in the corner, a little boy is playing the Rush Hour again.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What are you doing here?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ask him.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“I can’t get the red car out.”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He says.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“It’s stuck in a traffic jam.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There must be one and only one way to do it.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Leave it alone.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We have to get out of this place, not the goddamn toy car!”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What if the car gets lonely?”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“It doesn’t;</span> <span class="serif-roman">you do.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">You get lonely sometimes,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and you play puzzles, one after another.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But playing puzzles never stops you from being lonely.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So put that down,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and come with me.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He weeps.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“But I must get it out!</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Help me get it out!”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I part the debris to cross my legs beside him, as sands and rocks keep falling.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“One more puzzle,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we leave, okay?”</span></span>
