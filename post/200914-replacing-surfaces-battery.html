<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One friend of mine from the undergraduate physics department, Yimu, recently streamed on Facebook the process of assembling a Framework Laptop, which I have never heard of and find rather exotic.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It features its ability to be reassembled and repaired, unlike most mainstream laptops.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Regardless of how it is performing, this already sounds brave, since the more environment-friendly we are, the fewer computers we buy,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and tech companies know that.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Indeed, Microsoft and Apple often recommend you to let them recycle your old computer, in order to buy a new one with a discount plan.</span></span>
</p>

<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Around September 2020, my Surface Pro’s battery wasn’t functioning well;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it would only last roughly 2 or 3 hours if I was using OneNote.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, it was almost 3 year old,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and people said this was close to its lifespan.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fine.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was going to Syntrend [三創生活] to have the battery replaced.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the second floor of Syntrend, there was a Microsoft store.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I asked a young salesman about battery replacement,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he was rude, saying that nobody in this building was willing to fix a Surface battery, because it was too risky.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Considering to buy a new Surface, I went into the neighbouring New Guanghua Digital Plaza [光華數位新天地].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I might well buy a new Surface Pro 7 of the same model;</span> <span class="serif-roman">meanwhile Surface Pro X also attracted me despite being more expensive;</span> <span class="serif-roman">Surface Go was portable and cheap, which was appealing too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One and another computers were lined up on the tables, including several Surfaces;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I always found it amusing that the laptops displayed here, properly polished and lighted inside the glass window, looked so much fancier than the identical one I had in my backpack now.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There at another official Microsoft store, I discussed the features of Surface models with an elderly shop owner.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I mentioned that I initially wanted to replace the battery,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the Syntrend store claimed that such a thing was impossible.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“There is one repair store just upstairs which can do it”, he said.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“What?” I exclaimed, “why wasn’t the salesman honest with me?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The owner told me of the location, and asked me whether I wanted to buy a Surface any longer.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Perhaps not now”, I said.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“That is why he didn’t let you know”, said the owner, smiling slyly.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was struck and didn’t reply.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I gave my Surface to the repair store and took a rest at a coffee shop in Syntrend;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I quite liked to take a stroll in this department store, where there were all sorts of weird stuffs, from mechanical puzzles to high-end audio amplifiers,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I seldom bought a thing, as after a second thought I hardly found anything I really needed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A cozy afternoon passed,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and when it was almost 9pm, I returned to the repair store, surprised to see that it was done.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was charged about 5 000 NTD.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It has been a year,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the battery in my Surface is still working;</span> <span class="serif-roman">in fact, I am typing on it now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I regret that I didn’t buy anything from the elderly shop owner, even if (or precisely because) he helped me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Like him, here I have a secret to tell, which is really not a secret, that we all are something unnecessary, quick to be thrown away and replaced with, but pretending to be something necessary, by buying more unnecessary phones and watches, getting adorned with unnecessary clothes, and moving into bigger, unnecessary houses.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We are like an expired pork chop or a crumpled leaflet on the ground, priced but worthless.</span></span>
