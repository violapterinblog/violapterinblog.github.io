<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The first time I travel in some 4 years, in fact the first time I travel alone, I was going to Okinawa for a short 4-day vacation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Impressed by the MRT Airport Line, and pleased by the simplified boarding procedure of Eva Air, it took a little more than 1 hour from Taoyuan to Naha.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Given the Kanji obvious in meaning, it was more straightforward than I thought to figure out how to transfer by local monorail to Miebashi Station [美栄橋駅] close to where I was to dwell for 3 nights.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Along the neatly arranged blocks and traffic lights, I was able to get to the hotel, by following Google Maps (thanks to the affordable roaming plan of mobile company Docomo, about 300 NTD each day in price).</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The Smile Hotel Okinawa where I was staying, marked 3-star on Google Maps, was tidy and equipped with necessities,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it only cost about 2 000 NTD every night.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">From the hotel I went back to Miebashi Station to meet my friend Fangyi;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it was a 20-minute walk.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The street was full of Izakaya-bars and Yakiniku-grill restaurants, and of chained retail stores still opening late, the most pervasive being “Lawson”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By 9—it was here nominally 1 hour later than Taipei—I saw Fangyi by the Station.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She came to Okinawa too, together with another friend of ours, Peiling.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though staying in Okinawa in the same interval, we were only to meet tonight.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To elaborate, they first invited me to come with them,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but they regretted.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I appeared irritated,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and later I asked their pardon for my attitude.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In return, Fangyi said she and I could had a dinner the first day.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Meanwhile, Peiling had to work to meet the deadline on this long-planned vacation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Let us bless her and refrain from disturbing her.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Instead let us note, in front of us, the first place of interest as of today—but not for Fangyi, a seasoned traveler of Japan—The International Street [国際通り], where along the direction of radiant signs, lay a variety of shops and restaurants.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The very first eye-catching product was the glassware, a feature in Okinawa.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I purchased a spiral-curved glass cup in an attractive dark blue, resembling, and named after, the Blue Cave [青の洞窟] (where I wasn’t going to, since it was too cumbersome to swim or snorkel alone).</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Besides food, cosmetic shops were also said to be a must visit, for your information.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There were masks made of volcano dust, shampoo containing honey, Merlion-like lion figurines, and the peculiar sea grapes [海ぶどう] tasting crunchy and salty.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What I did bought was cheap packs of dried seaweed, cured fish, and a jar of chilies dipped in wine (though they were to be stopped in custom later).</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I also bought a case of Sablé cookie made with the featured salt of Chitan [北谷], intending to treat fellow Lab students, supporting the excuse for my absence in so doing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Food made up the most practical gifts.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fangyi and I walked westward along the International Street, and encountered a ramen shop, Koryu [康竜].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ordered a soy-sauce-flavored ramen simply called “Ramen”, served with rice with raw yolk.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was, as expected, salty but good.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fangyi had been to Germany when she was a child, and knew Japanese too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We commented on language learning experiences;</span> <span class="serif-roman">although I was embarrassed to admit that I had almost forgotten anything German I had learnt a few years ago, and my understanding of Japanese was no more than Duolingo level-one lessons taken days ago.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I shared a recent enlightenment with her.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In every language, there were so-called “content words” and “function words”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I found it instructive to think that function words add redundancy, analogous to error correction codes,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so that content words could resist from misreading and mishearing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And Japanese was particularly unusual in this regard, since it adopted two writing systems, Kana and Kanji.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was no accident, then, that Kana exhibited inflection in a wider sense, while Kanji could not,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so they complement each other.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We talked a lot, and were in a good mood.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Having returned to the monorail station, we parted,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I wished them two well.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Since I planned to catch an early bus to yonder Churaumi Aquarium in the northern part the island, I had better sleep now.</span></span>
