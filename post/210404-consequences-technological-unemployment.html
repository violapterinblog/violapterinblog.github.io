<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Scientists like to picture an utopia, where humans live in eternal happiness, served by machines and not having to work.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Indeed, many of my friends, whom I acquainted in electrical engineering or physics departments, seem to share such unlimited optimism,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but somehow excluded from the positive air, I always look at the pessimistic side.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Where did we diverge to drastically different views?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is what I don’t understand.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Optimists, pray tell me where I get it wrong.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With the advance of robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence alike, machines are becoming better and better;</span> <span class="serif-roman">they are faster, cheaper, more accurate, and never having to rest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Optimists think humans will excel at more creative jobs, leaving the routine tasks to machine;</span> <span class="serif-roman">but pessimists doubt these jobs are sufficient in number, or existent at all.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To compose a meaningful poem or construct a movement in sonata form, computers have a long way to go;</span> <span class="serif-roman">but they are more than serviceable to generate background music for games and automatic replies for customer service.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even doctors and lawyers start to seek computer’s help when finding patterns in innumerable cases.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To be sure, there are plenty “creative” jobs machines can qualify, if not all of them at present.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If machines really would replace our jobs, optimists gather there will be novel, irreplaceable jobs unimaginable to us by now;</span> <span class="serif-roman">yet when pessimists ask them what they are, they have no idea.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the Documentary short ‹Humans Need Not Apply›, we imagine two horses were having a conversation a hundred years ago, as thus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One horse feared that cars were going to replace horses;</span> <span class="serif-roman">another horse believed that it was to be a good thing that they no longer had to carry goods and gallop in battlefield,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and there would be more effortless jobs awaiting for them.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As it turned out, the demand of horse was plain decreasing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now they are mostly used for sports, movies, and mountain rangers.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Ridiculous as it is, aren’t human beings dreaming of the same?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If most people are unemployed, to optimists, all they have to do is relax in the beautiful new world.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe the surplus resource is enough for everybody to share,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so we no longer have to work,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we may rest, travel, and pursue hobbies at our heart’s desire.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nevertheless, pessimists wonder where our money comes from.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Perhaps rephrased more simply, labor, though a torture to many of us, is the only peaceful way to reliably allocate resources.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We let the invisible hand to distribute the wealth, not ideally but better than nothing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The fewer jobs there are, the more poor people there are;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it is that simple.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Machines do produce a lot of products,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but these can’t be sold by then:</span> <span class="serif-roman">the bourgeois class is vanishing,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the robots don’t purchase.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If the social inequality become heated,</span> <span class="serif-roman">some believe there will be efforts to reorganize the wealth;</span> <span class="serif-roman">maybe unconditional basic income is at hand.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But what if the society breaks down before reformation could happen?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Democracy took some 150 years, from 1789 to 1945, to mature, and not even peacefully.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">All the more, we don’t have a hundred years to save the humanity.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There will be upheavals both domestic and international.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Domestically, inequality will lead to riots;</span> <span class="serif-roman">without traditional jobs, violence is the only remaining way of distribution.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We either slay or suffer.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Internationally, as the core countries exploit the periphery countries, fascism will arise during the chaos in the latter,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the third world war is a matter of time.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Computers can serve us and save our labour,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it too can deprive us of our job undermine our economy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But to pessimists like me, it is more an express train, which we think will head to the heaven, but falls into the hell,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we are too scared to look out of the window.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With such risk unparalleled in history, the optimists are like, “the ship will cross the bridge when it comes over”;</span> <span class="serif-roman">is that a responsible attitude which scientists should have?</span></span>
