<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However there weren’t many restaurant nearby.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I walked into one, whose name I didn’t remark, and ordered a plate of several assorted sushi, which cost only a modest 1350 yen.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was fresh but not particularly impressive.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Outside, ferry boats and fishing boats were strung in a row, on which there were deeply tanned fishermen,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and far away, huge cruise boats could be seen.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the Google Maps, along the seashore it appeared possible to walk to Naminoue Shrine [波上宮],</span> <span class="serif-roman">but it was getting intolerably hot.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A ice cream vending machine read: Beware of heat strokes.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Next to the Shrine there was a small beach, where I thought I would be excited to take a sunbath,</span> <span class="serif-roman">although this idea now sounded like a self-imposed torture.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Up I climbed the hill, where the Torii-gate [鳥居] of the Shrine emerged.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I didn’t intend for the paid prayer services, as I wasn’t pious,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I did press my hands and close my eyes out of respect.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The string of paper pieces hung from the ceiling waved with the hot wind, below there was the donation chest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I donated all my coins less than 100 yen into the slits of the chest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By the shrine proper, out of the mouth of the Chinese-dragon-shaped stone statue, flowed water for purification use;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I followed the instruction to wash my hands and rinse my mouth.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Yesterday I was considering something like going to the underground cave Gyoku Sendo [玉泉洞], but having asked the staff I now found it too far away, and thus decided to visit the American village.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The bus number 28 will do.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One walked towards the conspicuous ferris wheel, and the houses made of faux wood, to enter the carnival park.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Rap songs were played,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and vintage posters were everywhere.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had a chili hot dog which wasn’t spicy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The place was a bit odd.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The atmosphere resembled more Disney than the US, just as not every single thing in Japan shouted that it was Japanese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Anyway, now it was only 2pm and I had no idea what to do.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I found, on Google Maps, a bike shop “Sunset Bicycle” that regularly closed in 6pm,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I came up the idea, having discussed with the shop owner, that, following the road 58, one might get to Cape Maeda [真栄田岬] or Cape Zanpa [残波岬] and come back, making an almost 30km round trip, which seemed not unreasonable.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For about half an hour, by a parking area near Kadena [嘉手納] as the sign read, there was a beach.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I kept sweating, and drank nearly three bottles of sparkling water—</span> <span class="serif-roman">I bought one as soon as I saw a vending machine.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Starting from Kadena, the pavement became bumped and narrow,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and though I managed to go inside residential districts to find easier roads, it could be dangerous to ride along with cars,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I always forgot keeping to the left.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was 3 and half,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I thought that if I didn’t made it before 6pm to return the bike, it would be extremely cumbersome.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Therefore I decided to turn around.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Along the seashore, fragmented bits of beach, with no one near, were all over the place.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Back to the American Village, I roamed by the beach for a while before returning the bike.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ordered a mediocre ramen in the mall, and, as if today’s plan wasn’t tightly packed enough, had another bowl of green-tea flavored shredded-ice [かき氷].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I hoped I could get up early tomorrow to visit Shuri Castle, to make most of the trip.</span></span>
