<main class="document">
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Yizhen asked me to go with her to an unusual performance of solo dance, titled “What a Girl Should Know”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was noted on the website to contain nudity,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and audience’s discretion was advised.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(It has been almost two years ago,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and my memory is vague at best;</span> <span class="serif-roman">by the way, I don’t want to be too specific either.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Queueing in a hall narrow and unlit, the audience would wait for assistants to tell them when and how many persons could now enter the curtained room, where the show was to take place.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On a table beside us was an old, worn book, “What a Girl Should Know”, which the show was named after.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By the residual sunlight I could skim some pages, where it urged that young girls ought to obey some conservative values.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I lifted the curtain, there was this female dancer, completely naked, holding a black marker in her mouth.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She likely asked me whether I thought it was okay to kiss (or make love?) on a first date with someone.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I said yes.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She asked me to write “yes” anywhere on her body;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I wrote it on her right thigh replete already with black words, mostly “yes” but some “no” too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She ushered me to sit in the very first row, making me edgy in silently anticipating the show.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She did that to everyone;</span> <span class="serif-roman">she would ask a question related to sex, then accompanied us one by one to our seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The distribution of seat appeared to be grouped depending on one’s answer.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a small square theater with tiered seats.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Those inside waited for quite long, some 15 minutes, for the routine until everybody was in;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it was far from a full house,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and out of boredom I turned back to count people, straining my eyes in the darkness.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I turned again to the front, the dancer was in front of me, which surprised me,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and she asked me whether I wanted to change seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Taking some seconds to realize the meaning of her words, I said no.</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the stage were some cube-shaped boxes served as chairs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer stretched, jumped, rolled on the ground, displaced objects, and try on cloths and shook them off.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer was having hair dyed yellow, a figure slim but sturdy, was medium-breasted, and shaved of pubic hair.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The section was short, not virtuosic, and not resembling a well-rounded piece of dance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Overall, the matter-of-fact tone in her movement did not strike me as sexy, and rightly so.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the next section, some of us (including me) were summoned to go up on the stage, men and women too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This, I wasn’t expected;</span> <span class="serif-roman">wasn’t sure if it was warned of on the brochure either.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer started by asking who wanted to “date her”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I raised hands along with other people, although, I thought, it was totally weird.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She might have asked some heated questions, like whether one accepted only a virgin, whether it was okay to be bisexual, or whether one insisted to go dutch.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She then asked whether “you are a feminist”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Curious of the consequence of dissent, I didn’t raise my hand this time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People looked at me,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the dancer gestured me to leave the stage.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The awkward moment made me somewhat regret for doing so,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but being seated again I was far more comfortable.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Shortly, men and women left for their respective disagreeing answer,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and only one young woman, dressed plainly and looking timid, remained on the stage now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer tried to embrace the woman with a seducing smile;</span> <span class="serif-roman">she caressed the woman erotically and lifted her top.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The woman seemed to be confused too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer either asked the woman whether she (the dancer) could kiss her, or only gestured to do so,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the woman refused.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The show had thus ended abruptly.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Afterwards, Yizhen talked with the dancer for a while, with me beside them.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The dancer explained her motivation, that dating was a process of gradually discovering the mutual differences;</span> <span class="serif-roman">she was criticized on the internet,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but she didn’t care.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She then remarked that one guy looked impatient as if he wanted to change seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I said that was I,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I didn’t want to change seat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(She must have failed to recognize me because it was too dark.)</span></span>
