<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Just as yesterday, I asked a staff of the monorail station, and went to Naha Bus Terminal at Asahibashi [旭橋].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had to get on bus 117 to go to the Beautiful Aquarium [美ら海水族館].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a good 2-hour drive to the Aquarium;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I didn’t know it was that far.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though having slept little, I couldn’t fall asleep on the bumpy highway.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By Nago City perhaps, the bus emerged out of weeds and tombs,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and afterwards it followed the highway along the seashore.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had plenty time watching in solitude the sea, which extended to the unfathomable skyline, and brooding on what misery the mankind was in, and completing the boring writing which this travel journal was.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One got off “in front of the Memorial Park” [記念公園前], which was exactly the entrance of the Ocean Expo Park.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was moderately hot, but quite humid in the air.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Following the brochures, one walked for some 5 minutes to the right to enter the Aquarium.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a shark statue in front of the door, which I would soon realize what it stand for.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With the 1850 yen ticket, one got into the building crowded with people;</span> <span class="serif-roman">many were downright excited kids, some of them speaking Chinese.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the first room one could touch the sea stars and sea urchins, if done gently.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a big fish tank with wall made of magnifying glass,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so that a variety of fish could be closely examined.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A swirling school of clownfish (to which people exclaimed “Nemo”, referring to «Finding Nemo»), a huge scary sweetlips, a trumpetfish resembling a stick, sea turtles which whipped its limbs to the surface, and a ray with funny protruding eyes.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a myriad of creatures I couldn’t name.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These seemingly meaningless encyclopedia entries had, at that moment, turned into vivid bone and flesh in front of me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How alienated have we been from the real nature surrounding us?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We weren’t far from thinking a sushi bar menu is a close likeness to the fish.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I thought that that was it, I was wrong;</span> <span class="serif-roman">what was in the next room was nothing less.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A still larger, incredibly large creature, as wide as several adult’s height, swam casually across the curved glass wall, near the surface of water;</span> <span class="serif-roman">spectators exclaimed in their language in earnest awe.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a whale shark.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now I just laughed at myself for having considered those sea basses to be large.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A dented canopy enabled us to directly look, under it, the whale sharks from below,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so I could examine its fins and abdomen closely, in a frightening angle.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">At 1 and half, a diver went into the tank to shot real-time video of these sea creatures, which was shown on a screen.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Not in their natural home, they required great care by the staff.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We were still uncertain about what they ate, the written notes said.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The staff even had the female whale sharks taken the ultrasound scan, with help by Taiwanese researchers, when it was about to give birth to baby sharks.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nevertheless, they must find the tank (or to them, the bowl) to be depressingly small, barely possible to let them turn around as recklessly as in the ocean, though the tank had been recognized as the largest fish tank in the world.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What would the whale sharks be like if they could go back to the sea?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They were to plunge merrily perhaps, once they felt like it, into the deepest ocean which the mankind perceived to be mere endless darkness, and again to rise onto the surface of water in no time.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Beside the tank for the whale sharks, there were miscellaneous tanks inhabiting other deep sea creatures.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That was made possible by specially designed device which exerted extra pressure, as explained on a plaque.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The lobsters were as big as an adult’s chest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The jellyfish, glowing under the ultraviolet light, were eating something eerily while wielding its tentacles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And the flashlightfish in the darkness could only be recognized by its distinctive fluorescent stripe.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thinking it was possible to go into the Aquarium again, I felt like that was enough for the moment, and followed my whim to visit the plant gardens pictured on the brochure.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Next to the Aquarium building, there were several pools for manatees and sea turtles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A dolphin show, as I passed by, had just ended.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Southwards were more butterflies and bees, and tropical plants with prickling leaves,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and there crow caw could be heard.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The plant garden didn’t seem as impressive as the Aquarium was.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fearing that the bus time might be unpredictable, I decided, by almost 4pm, that I go back to wait for the returning bus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The bus soon came, which was the next-to-last one,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I called it a day.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By now I had had nothing impressive, except an Onigiri bought in the morning by the Naha terminal station, and a shabby soba-noodle in a stand by the Aquarium,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so I was really hungry.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">After going back to the hotel and having rested for a moment, it was already 8pm,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and what was still opening might only be Izakaya-bars.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have never been to a Izakaya-bar.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Speaking of that, this area, reading Maejima [前島] on the map, appeared right at the center of an aggregation of Izakaya-bars;</span> <span class="serif-roman">there were more than a dozen ones within walking distance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I crossed a street to go into the nearest one, Umi no Chinboraa [海のちんぼらぁ], judging from the 4-star rating on Google Maps.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The staff welcomed me to a low wooden seat, near the bar adorned with seashells;</span> <span class="serif-roman">there, through the glass surrounding the open kitchen, fish slices could be seen, on which diligently working cooks worked in front of me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ordered a dish of rice, fried with fish shreds and served with sea urchin.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Orion Beer, a feature of Okinawa, could be refilled free, as seemed to be the norm.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Quickly I realized that it was a somewhat weird that I was typing alone here, since I could tell from the environment that the place served usually for gatherings of business people or friends.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I tried not to be embarrassed, and ordered another soy-sauce-stewed fish;</span> <span class="serif-roman">the stewed fish certainly tasted like one of the best of its kind I had ever had, cooked just to the right point, and rightly contrasting the bitter but smooth Orion beer.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Later that day I would leave a 5-star rating for this inconspicuous bar;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I told the cook so, not sure whether they could understand English.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">At least, the fish alone cost some 1 400 yen,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and this amount ought to be forgotten.</span></span>
