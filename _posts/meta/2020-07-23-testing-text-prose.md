In Congress, July 4, 1776.

__*The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,*__ When in the __Course__ of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the __Laws of Nature__ and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, $$\displaystyle\int_1^2 xdx$$ --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. $$\dfrac{3}{4}$$ Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

孔乙己是站著喝酒而穿長衫的唯一的人。他身材很高大；青白臉色，皺紋間時常夾些傷痕；一部亂蓬蓬的花白的鬍子。穿的雖然是長衫，可是又髒又破，似乎十多年沒有補，也沒有洗。他對人說話，總是滿口之乎者也，教人半懂不懂的。因為他姓孔，別人便從描紅紙上的「上大人孔乙己」，這半懂不懂的話裏，替他取下一個綽號，叫作孔乙己。 __孔乙己一到店，所有喝酒的人便都看著他笑，有的叫道：「孔乙己，你臉上又添上新傷疤了！」__ 他不回答，對櫃裡說：「溫兩碗酒，要一碟茴香豆。」便排出九文大錢。 __他們又故意的高聲嚷道：「你一定又偷了人家的東西了！」__ 孔乙己睜大眼晴說：「你怎麼這樣憑空污人清白……」「什麼清白？我前天親眼見你偷了何家的書，吊著打。」孔乙己便漲紅了臉，額上的青筋條條綻出，爭辯道：「竊書不能算偷……竊書！……讀書人的事，能算偷麼？」$$\dfrac{3}{4}$$接連便是難懂的話，什麼「君子固窮」，什麼「者乎」之類，引得眾人都哄笑起來：店內外充滿了快活的空氣。

聽人家背地裏談論，孔乙己原來也讀過書，但終於沒有進學，又不會營生；於是愈過愈窮，弄到將要討飯了。幸而寫得一筆好字，便替人家抄抄書，換一碗飯吃。可惜他有一樣壞脾氣，便是好喝懶做。$$\displaystyle \int_1^2 xdx$$做不到幾天，便連人和書籍、紙張、筆硯，一齊失蹤。如是幾次，叫他鈔書的人也沒有了。孔乙己沒有法，便免不了偶然做些偷竊的事。但他在我們店裏，品行卻比別人都好，就是從不拖欠；雖然間或沒有現錢，暫時記在粉板上，但不出一月，定然還清，從粉板上拭去了孔乙己的名字。
