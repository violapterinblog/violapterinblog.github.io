On July 18 2019, about 5:30 pm in Taiwan, I registered a second GitHub account for this GitHub page, and the new site is born!
See [GitHub Page Logbook]() for a detailed trail of thought and [Why I Moved to GitHub Page]() to elaborate some core reasons.
I will import some past posts and modify the time stamp accordingly, and let this very notice attest the moment, preventing myself from forgetting what is supposedly a new start.
