July 18, 2020: Created 2nd GitHub account to use the one-time right GH provides with every account.
Looks rather complicated. Maybe it's only me, as I have zero experience with web development.
Hope such effort will turn out to be worthwhile.

July 19: Directly use the [Jekyll template](https://github.com/jekyll/example) provided officially on GitHub, and my site works on localhost for the first time.

July 20: Realized that Jekyll allow protected html code, so that I may actually define my own format, implemented in html, and incorporated in the markdown, to let Jekyll process it.
Tested mathjax for the first time, it works.
However, I still hope the font families of `textrm`, `textsf`, `texttt` can be customzed.
