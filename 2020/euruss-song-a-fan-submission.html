    <p>Just finished Sherlock Season 4, Episode 3, The Final Problem.
(Slight spoilers below.)
The characterization of Eurus Holmes is haunting.
The lyrics can be found on 
    <a href="https://bakerstreet.fandom.com/wiki/Eurus%27_Song_(The_Musgrave_Ritual)">Baker Street Wiki: Eurus’s Song</a>.
But it seems to me Eurus’s Song is not entirely satisfying.
As pointed out, the tune is based on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4vxDJKjoBI">Go Tell Aunt Rhody</a>,
but the lyrics is not shown in its entirety.
Moreover, it is not properly rhymed,
nor does it fit the meter.
As the cypher is purportedly based on the dates on the gravestone of the Holmes graveyard, which is not fully spelled out either,
the deciphering can seem arbitrary.</p>

<p>Thus, I decided to write my own fan-fiction poem and propose a simple cypher.</p>

<p><strong>O by the stream, look, mother goose <br />
At last does at one gosling weep. <br />
In shadows will want she a noose; <br />
Of course, my friend, care not her sleep.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do kids forlorn, save someone sober, <br />
Her favorite tree tend, which grows wild? <br />
Her feathers fall ere this October; <br />
Her laughter will doom that sane child.</strong></p>

<p><strong>O breeze, pray not mind youngsters cunning; <br />
Your breathing rids, kin to the mills, <br />
The blood beside lone rivers running, <br />
One mile around there where it kills.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do East Winds gay come to the flowers, <br />
And siblings too play as they bath? <br />
And does the goose find that for hours <br />
Her babies make room for their death?</strong></p>

<p>Don’t ask me what the poem means!
I just scrambled the lyrics proper, and those of <em>Go Tell Aunt Rhody</em>, and let unleashed my creativity, following what the imagery led me.
Anyway, I do hope my poem is creepy enough.
(By the way, the <em>Go Tell Aunt Rhody</em> already reads creepy,
and so are many Mother Goose tales.
No wonder Agatha Christie was inspired of <em>And Then There Were None</em>.)</p>

<p>If read by every four words, my poem yields:</p>

<p><strong>O look at one in want of care, <br />
Do save and tend her, ere her doom. <br />
O mind your kin, the lone one there, <br />
Do come and play and find her room.</strong></p>

<p>This fits the rest of the story, where the plain text reveals to Sherlock that Eurus has been lonely, and indicates him to come to her room (of young Eurus’s).</p>

<p>My poem can fit the tune of <em>Go Tell Aunt Rhody</em>, though one has to read 2nd and 3rd syllables in one beat, and it probably works better when just being read out according to iambic tetrameter.</p>

<p>I posted my poem on Reddit, expecting it to become a hit.
Nobody replied,
and only 2 or 3 people upvoted.
This already made me feel silly
when I again read these unsensical lines I have just composed.
Maybe I shouldn’t have spent about 3 hours writing the poem?
Or maybe I shouldn’t have spent about 20 hours watching <em>Sherlock</em>.</p>

  We're not doomed.
  In the grand scheme of things, we're just tiny specks that will one day be forgotten.
  The only thing that matters is right now.
  This one spectacular moment we are sharing together.
  Right, Sarah Lynn?
